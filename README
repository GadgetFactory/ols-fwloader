This is commandline utility for Diolan bootloader.

OLS - Logic analyzer (http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Open_Bench_Logic_Sniffer)

OLS uses modified bootloader. The original fw_update tool does make life harder.
I have therefore created this tool. Simple, yet effective.

License is yet to be added. For now assume GPLv3 license.

- Requirements
  linux:
    cdc_acm support in kernel
    libusb 1.0

  win:
    cdc acm driver


- To make:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

  I suggest to use --prefix parameter.

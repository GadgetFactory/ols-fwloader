This is commandline utility for Diolan bootloader.

OLS - Logic analyzer (http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Open_Bench_Logic_Sniffer)

OLS uses modified bootloader. The original fw_update tool does make life harder.
I have therefore created this tool. Simple, yet effective.

License is yet to be added. For now assume GPLv3 license.


Furure plan includes integration with ols-loader.
